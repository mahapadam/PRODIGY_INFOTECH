TASK 3
To build a decision tree to predict whether a customer will purchase a good or service based on their demographic and behavioural data. The dataset had missing values and class imbalance. cleaned and preprocessed data. Used RandomForestClassifier() model. To deal with the class imbalance used oversampling algorithm SMOTE and undersampling algorithm NearMiss. Since the model was performing better for SMOTE, proceeded with it and performed hyperparameter tuning using RandomizedSearchCV. Accuracy_score, Classification_report and Confusion_martix are used for model evaluation
